<b>What is the btcPOS?:</b>

It's the ideal web based point-of-sale (POS) solution for restaurants, bars, caf√©s, and all retail merchants accepting Bitcoin. btcPOS can easily give merchants the ability to accept bitcoin payments in store fronts.

Our goal is to bring the web service of crypto-currencies into the 'real world' in every way possible, without the merchant requiring a specialized POS or or register for accepting payments. We want nothing less than for every merchant, storefront, vending machine, parking garage, subway turnstile, taxicab, and whatever-else-can-be-imagined, to accept payments with crypto-currencies.

Just set up an account on btcPOS with your bitcoin wallet address and your business can start receiving Bitcoin payments.

(advertise your BTC acceptance and bring new customers in!)
